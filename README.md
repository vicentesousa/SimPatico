# Welcome to SimPatico: Simulation Tool for the Analysis of TDOA
Simulation PlAtform for PosiTIon LoCatiOn evaluation (SimPatico) contains a variety of TDOA methods, including angle of arrival (AoA) and robust algorithms that are not scope of this work. There are also degradation models for gaussian and non-gaussian channels such as GMM and S$\alpha$S processes. It is possible to evaluate synthetic and real data.

Simulator outcomes are produced in terms of performance metrics of the direction of arrival (DoA) algorithms and they are saved in data files and plots.

## Features
- Several AoA (Angle-of-Arrival) and TDOA (Time Difference Of Arrival) algorithms.
- Robust algorithms for impulsive noise.
- Functions to generate Gaussian and non-Gaussian channels.
- Functions to compute performance metrics of DOA (Direction Of Arrival) algorithms.
- Functions to save the results and plots.
- Several useful utility functions.
